# 1. Features
#  - Hosted on AWS.
#  - Remote infrastructure setup using Terraform and Ansible.
#  - VPC with 3 public and 2 private subnets.
#  - Public subnets host the Bastion, Elastic Load Balancer, and Nat Instance.
#  - Private subnets host EC2 instances running Ubuntu for the weather app.
#  - Both the ELB and the private servers are available in diferent availability zones.
#  - Uses Route53 DNS for name resolution and traffic management.
#  - Uses prexisting hosted zone for SOA and NS records already registered with NameCheap for the domain name.
#  - Uses ACM for TLS/SSL certification for site security and encryption.
#  - SSL Certificate is attached to the ELB.
#  - ELB takes incoming traffic on port 80 and 443 and redirects it to port 80 on the private servers.
#  - HTTP correctly redirects to HTTPS using a redirect in the apache conf files.
#  - LAMDA function runs the servers on the weekend to cut server costs.
#  - Webservers on the private network only accept ssh connections from the bastion.
#  - Admins can ssh into the bastion on the bastion public subnet to gain access to the private servers.
#  - Fail2ban is running on the bastion to prevent brute force attacks.
#  - AWS Backups create snapshots of EBS volumes and DynamoDB tables on a weekly basis every Monday at 1am.
#
